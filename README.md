# Future Me Notes for To-Do List App (Paused)

- **Where I left off:** Setting up Projects and task to show up on the inbox section - for all tasks
- **What works so far:** 
  - Can create projects.
  - Can delete projects
  - Can add tasks to projects.
  - Can delete the tasks from projects
  - Can check off completed tasks
- **Whatâ€™s missing:**
  - Displaying all task in the Inbox section
  - UI to add/view tasks description (maybe using DOM manipulation).
  - Saving projects to localStorage.
  - Using the date api given in the instructions
- **My thoughts when I stopped:** 
  - Feeling a bit stuck on how to implement checked status in task objects
  - Feeling a bit unmotivated on continuing the same thing
- **Plan for when I come back:**
  - work on adding a check status in the task objects which will be used to remake the checked function
  - this will allow me to display the tasks correctly in the inbox section

ðŸ’¬ Reminder: It's okay to be messy at first. Future Me is going to know more anyway!
